# FE Build Setup
hello, im here to create initial FE build setup with build tools and required libraries 

# Build system:
Build system is simply a collection of tasks commonly known as task runners that automate repetitive work.
Tasks can be anything from compiling pre-process CSS, JavaScript to concatenation &  minification and
firing up a server for automatic browser reloading and even things like creating deployment builds.
